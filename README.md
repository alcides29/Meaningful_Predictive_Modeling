# Meaningful Predictive Modeling
Course by UC San Diego on Coursera - Python Data Products for Predictive Analytics Specialization 

## Requirements
* [Anaconda with Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* Jupyter Notebook (installed wit Anaconda)

## Key Concepts
* Week 1: Understand the definitions of simple error measures (e.g. MSE, accuracy, precision/recall). Evaluate the performance of regressors / classifiers using the above measures. Understand how to classify mismatches between labels and predictions.
* Week 2: Understand techniques to avoid overfitting and achieve good generalization performance. Learn how to create a bag of words with Python's NLPK. Understand how classifiers relate to rankings
* Week 3: Understand the difference between training/testing performance, and generalizability. Training, testing, and when to retrain models. Understand techniques to avoid overfitting and achieve good generalization performance.
* Week 4: Split a dataset into proper training, testing, and validation sets. Evaluate the results of a supervised learning model. Avoid overfitting by implementing regularization on a model.
